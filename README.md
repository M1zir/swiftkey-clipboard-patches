# M1zir’s SwiftKey Clipboard Patches

Maintained by **Abubakr Ahmed (M1zir)**.

Experimental Morphe bundle for **Microsoft SwiftKey 9.13.19.3**
(`com.touchtype.swiftkey`). Based on
[murilosimao/swiftkey-patch v0.1.1](https://github.com/murilosimao/swiftkey-patch/releases/tag/v0.1.1),
commit `2d6d054b387d5b39a8d35d35d335a478a542306b`.

[Add this source to Morphe](https://morphe.software/add-source?github=M1zir/swiftkey-clipboard-patches) · [Releases](https://github.com/M1zir/swiftkey-clipboard-patches/releases)

## Use on Android

1. Copy **swiftkey-clipboard-patches-0.2.0.mpp** to your Android device.
2. In Morphe, open **Sources → Add → Local** and select that file.
3. Select an **original, unpatched SwiftKey 9.13.19.3 APK**.
4. Select **Keep clipboard history forever**. Deselect the other three patches
   if you only want clipboard history.
5. Patch the app and install the resulting APK through Morphe.
6. Turn on **Rich input → Clipboard → Remember copied items** in SwiftKey.

Menu wording can vary. The bundle includes JVM classes and DEX for Desktop and
Android loaders. Desktop application was verified; Android Manager import and
operation still need a device test.

The modified APK has a different signature from Microsoft's app. Android may
refuse to install it over the official installation. Save important clips and
settings before any uninstall, which erases local app data. Keep Morphe's signing
key for future updates.

## Behavior

The new patch disables local age expiry and fixes timestamp comparison for clips
weeks or years apart. It preserves manual deletion, pin/unpin, clipboard
enable/disable, and the existing save/load code.

No fixed entry-count cap was found in this version's local collection and JSON
save/load paths, so no numeric limit replacement is needed. “Forever” means no
automatic age expiry, not infinite device storage. SwiftKey loads the list and
rewrites it when saving; very large histories can become slow. Expired clips
cannot be recovered.

Screenshots and images successfully added to SwiftKey’s clipboard use this same
local expiry rule. SwiftKey copies screenshot images into its private
`clipboard_images` directory. Real-device screenshot retention remains untested.

Cloud sync, remote deletion, duplicate handling, and single-slot incoming cloud
clipboard behavior remain native. This is **local history retention**, not an
unlimited cloud archive. Image availability can depend on source URIs and files.
The patch adds no permissions, network calls, separate clipboard collector, or
database. SwiftKey's existing interface text is unchanged, including any mention
of one hour.

The bundle retains the optional **Customise toolbar**, **Disable telemetry**,
and **Disable cloud sign-in prompt** patches. The toolbar editor retains upstream
Portuguese labels. See [original documentation](docs/UPSTREAM_README.md).

## Validation

See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for the input hash, passed checks, and limitations.
The patch validates package/version, class strings, method signatures, opcode
sequences, and references. It stops on a changed or already patched target.

Microsoft's [version listing](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/swiftkey-keyboard/for-microsoft-swiftkey-commercial-partners)
listed 9.13.19.3 as latest on 2026-11-10. Verification used its original ARM64 APK.
Beta and future versions are not declared compatible. Apply all desired patches
in one pass to an original APK.

## Build and local verification

Requires JDK 21+, Python 3.11+, curl, and Android SDK platform 36.
Set `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_HOME`:

```sh
python3 scripts/bootstrap.py
./gradlew buildAndroid
./scripts/patch.sh /absolute/path/to/original-9.13.19.3.apk
```

Output: `patches/build/libs/swiftkey-clipboard-patches-0.2.0.mpp`.
Public tools are pinned with checksums; no GitHub token is needed.
The patch script selects only the clipboard patch and verifies its emitted
bytecode; it does not install the APK. Test APKs and signing material stay local.

Use `./scripts/build.sh` to also run the upstream JVM/UI tests.
The UI tests require a Robolectric-supported host; Linux ARM64 is unsupported.
